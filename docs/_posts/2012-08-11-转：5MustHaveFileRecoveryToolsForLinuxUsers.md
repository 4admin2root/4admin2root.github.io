Creating a backup of your computer is a wise idea. It helps avoid losing your  files to accidental deletions. But if your hard disk is damaged some way or the  data is lost without you having its backup, file recovery programs are your best  bet.

Like all other application types, Windows users will find a plethora of  options when it comes file recovery software. Options for Linux users, on the  other hand, are limited. Thus we decided to share the top 5 file recovery apps  for our Linux reader. We hope you find todays list helpful.

### **[Ddrescue](http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/ddrescue.html)**

Ddrescue is a wonderful file recovery program that operates automatically.  Without prompting the user for timely actions, it copies data from one file or  bloc to another, attempting to rescue data in case of read errors. If not asked  to, the app will not truncate the output file or write zeros to the output when  bad sectors are found in the input. Thus **every time you run it on the same  output file, it tries to fill in the gaps without wiping out the data already  rescued.**

### **[Safecopy](http://safecopy.sourceforge.net/)**
