## Why Puppet

As system administrators acquire more and more systems to manage, automation of mundane tasks is increasingly important. Rather than develop in-house scripts, it is desirable to share a system that everyone can use, and invest in tools that can be used regardless of ones employer. Certainly doing things manually doesnt scale.

- It provides a powerful framework to simplify the majority of the technical tasks that sysadmins need to perform
- The sysadmin work is written as code in Puppets custom language which is shareable just like any other code.

This means that your work as a sysadmin can get done much faster, because you can have Puppet handle most or all of the details, and you can download code from other sysadmins to help you get done even faster. The majority of Puppet implementations use at least one or two modules developed by someone else, and there are already hundreds of modules developed and shared by the community.<img src="http://static.blog.csdn.net/xheditor/xheditor_emot/default/smile.gif" alt="微笑" />
